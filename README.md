This folder has all the projects of the Intro. to A.I. class

# Project#1
In this project, we got inspired from Sebastien Lague (@SebLague) and the Batman Animated Series to create the different path finding algorithms for both informed and uninformed search, mainly (in order) DFS: Depth First Search, BFS: Breadth First Search, UCS: Uniform Cost Search, A* with different heuristics (Euclidean and Manhattan). The result was all the paths (using all methods, each color represents a method) from a seeker point (Batman) to the target (Bat Mobile). The methods each took a specific amount of Time, the number processed Nodes, as well as the fringe where we can see the order of the processed Nodes either using a Queue or a Stack.

You can find both the code and the report above!
